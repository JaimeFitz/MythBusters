# MythBusters
# Using data science, what myths will we find are plausible? Which will be busted?

I was reading a thread last night where people were discussing the myth that ancient humans only lived to be around 30 years old. I've heard this myth many times, and I think I may have even helped perpetuate it before I knew it was false. 
What the posters said next gave me an idea, though. Someone said that the number was skewed by infant mortality rates, which weren't treated as outliers when calculating a mean lifespan value. What if I could bust this myth using data science?
Biology and archeology isn't my area of expertise, but from what I understand, scientists can often estimate the ages that ancient humans reached before death. While Neanderthals didn't keep birth and death records, many ancient civilizations left behind some valuable clues about lifespan.
Additionally, bones and mummies can be dated using medical science. I'm sure somebody smarter than me has already estimated how old Otzi the Iceman was before he died.

This is only an example of what myths I'd like to bust, but it's a great starting point. Having worked in childcare for half a decade, I've heard many myths be perpetuated as we answer a kiddo's question with the same answer we were given as children.
There are many instances where I've caught myself after repeating something to a kid, stopping to actually critically think about it. "Is that still true? I think the science may have changed since my kindergarten days.". 
Many times this has lead to me looking up the question (thank goodness for smartphones!) and learning right alongside the children.

Obviously I have other projects taking priority right now, but I wanted to write this out and start a repository so I don't lose the idea. If Adam or Jamie from Mythbusters stumble upon this, I'm a lifelong fan. Thanks for making the best after-school TV ever!
